# Beatomic

Use atoms to create beats!

## What?

Made in ~24h for the [Orbital Game Jam 7 - Atomic](https://itch.io/jam/orbital-game-jam-7).

Code source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Amustache/Beatomic).

## How to play?

[**Play it live on Itch.io!**](https://astache.itch.io/beatomic)

Simply drag and drop samples on the electrons.

## Known bugs!

- The game crashes when you go back in the periodic table and select another element.
- The visual beat is not in sync with the effective beat.
- Sometimes a sample is put on multiple electrons at once.

## In-depth

I wanted to make a rhythm/mix/beat making game using atomic orbitals. I wanted to exploit the [electron configurations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration) of different atoms, which describe the different electrons in an atom. There are several layers/sublayers of atoms, and I'd like you to be able to place instruments on the different electrons, according to the different layers, to make music.

Ideally, once you've managed to create your different beats with your different atoms, you'd be able to make [chemical formulas](https://studentsdisha.in/chemical-names-and-formulas/) using the beats you've made.

The periodic table of elements will serve as your sample table, and then you can compose your chemical reductions to get your giga-music at the end.

Also, it can be quite pretty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital)!

## More

I spent a lot of time to figure out what I wanted exactly, how to balance it wrt [electron configurations](https://periodictableguide.com/electron-configuration-chart-of-all-elements/), and what exactly I wanted to incorporate.

I don't think I will try to make the chemical formula bit because I'm not sure how to handle it, but that can be for an interesting next step.
